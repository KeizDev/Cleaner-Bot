This tool is designed to put a server on hold while you finish the backup or simply change the owner.

This bot performs the following actions:

    Deletes all channels (except for one that you specify)
    Deletes all roles
    Creates a role of your choice without permissions and assigns it to all members

We are currently on version 1.0, and graphical updates will be coming soon.
